# CS362-HW4
Homework 4 for Computer Science 362: Computational Biology.

This assignment is to create two programs. One which is called assembly and creates a De Bruijn Graph and Dot Graph for a given reads file. The second is called simulate and is meant to simulate a genome given a reads file with equal chance of mutation across all nucleotides.

Questions answered for the project:

1. Our code is python and so doesn't need to compile. In the program, we import sys and random. For assemble.sh, we use graphviz in order to create the DOT file.

2. There are no known bugs. 

3. We decided to utilise two classes for our assemble program: vertex and graph. These create essentially a graph via a dictionary.

4. This project was written by Adam Ickler and Kristin Albright. We discussed the effect of larger files on the efficacy of the program with Layla Oesper.
